# hchess
Haskell chess program.  In a very rough state.

Currently the other player (always black at the moment) is using minimax with alpha-beta pruning (not currently working).

TODO:

1) Improve board evaluation

2) Fix alpha-beta pruning algorithm

3) Option for 2 players; vs. AI with random starting color

4) Refactoring modules

5) GUI using functional reactive programming with Sodium
